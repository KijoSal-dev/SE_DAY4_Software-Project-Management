Fast paced environment
Collaborative environments

Examples of agile projects :
Software development
Marketing campaigns

When waterfall is more beneficial :
Well defined and stable requirements
Regulatory and compliance requirements
Fixed budget and schedule
Predctable and sequential processes

Examples of waterfall :
Construction projects eg building a bridge
Manufacturing 
Government and aerospace projects
